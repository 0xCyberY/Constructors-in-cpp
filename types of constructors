Different types of constructors
Default constructor or Zero Argument Constructor
Default constructor is the constructor which doesn’t take any argument. It has no parameters.
Parameterized constructor
The constructor that can take arguments are called parameterized constructor.
Copy constructor
A copy constructor is a member function which initializes an object using another object of the same class.


2. Parameterized Constructors:
It is possible to pass arguments to constructors.
These arguments help initialize an object when it is created.
To create a parameterized constructor, simply add parameters to it the way you would to any other function.
When you define the constructor‟s body, use the parameters to initialize the object.


3. Copy Constructor: A
copy constructor is a member function which initializes an object using another object of the same class.
