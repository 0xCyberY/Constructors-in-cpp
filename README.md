# Constructors-in-cpp
A constructor is a member function of a class which initializes objects of a class. 
In C++, Constructor is automatically called when object(instance of class) create. It is special member function of the class. 
How constructors are different from a normal member function?

1. Constructor has same name as the class itself 
2. Constructors don‟t have return type 
3. A constructor is automatically called when an object is created. 
4.If we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates a default constructor for us (expects no parameters and has an empty body).
